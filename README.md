# PHP Tutorials

## Introduction

These tutorials are now a few years old and in some places would benefit from being updated to PHP 7.x, however the basic introduction to PHP is fine and suitable for someone just getting started with PHP.

## Getting Started

These tutorial exercises must be placed on a functioning PHP server. 

A convenient solution is to install a server environment on your own computer. MAMP is a good choice and is available for both Mac OSX and Windows operating systems. If you are running Linux at home you should be able to install a LAMP stack on your computer.

## Tutorial Exercises

Each tutorial exercise is contained within its own directory labelled ex001, ex002 and so on. In most cases you simply need to edit the code in the index.php file. When this is not the case you will be given specific instructions. **Do not** change the directory structure within the tutorial folder.

The instructions for each exercise are in the comments of the relevant index.php file so open the file in a code editor and read the instructions

## Things to do

1. Update to PHP 7.x as required
2. Add video tutorials as required
3. Tidy up some minor errors
