/* If you were to use the str_replace function of the following string
	"When sue pollard went to the poll she could not vote"
and tried to replace "poll" with "ballot box" you would get
	"When sue ballot boxard went to the ballot box she could not vote"
	
Write a better version of the str_replace function, using the same parameter structure
but which only replaces complete words.

The function name should be better_str_replace

You must include the function description in the comments as in previous examples.
