/* Exercise 011c - More complex example
Look at the files that make up this tutorial web site. You will see that there is
only one page - index.php - and all other content is included in this page as
required.

Look in the includes directory and the pages directory to see how the content is 
organised. This is only one of many options but works well for sites that 
may grow in size.
